Right now I am trying to get the animation sequence fixed.
Currently I need the correct measurements transfered and used in the animation, but the animation is working.

Once that is complete, then we need to set up the structure necessary to execute cut and paste functions once the animation is complete.

Animation has been successfully implemented. Right now, the only set left is to fix the margin spacing. Specifically, we need to apply 
viewport sizing to the margins and positioning.
Next - We need to correct the card click event management.

Need to make the face down card in the Tableau flip after the move has been moved. Currently need to find a way to capture the tableau name before
the card is move, then use that name after the card has moved to execute the flipping of the top card.

Game is now fully functional and seems to be sizing properly. Need to finish/add the following features
 - Animated card flip
 - Add undo features
 - Add drag and drop
 - Add auto solve feature
 - Address zIndex issue with moving cards
 - Need to adjust tableau top margin so that it is flexible
